üöÄ Project Title & Tagline
==========================

**Project Title:** AI Tools
**Tagline:** A suite of AI-powered tools for text-to-speech, image generation, and background removal.

üìñ Description
==============

AI Tools is a collection of React components that utilize various AI APIs to provide innovative features for text-to-speech, image generation, and background removal. This project aims to simplify the process of integrating AI capabilities into web applications, making it easier for developers to create engaging and interactive user experiences.

With AI Tools, you can:

* Convert text to speech using the Text-to-Speech API
* Generate images from text using the Text-to-Image API
* Remove backgrounds from images using the Background Remover API

These features are designed to be easily integrated into your existing React applications, allowing you to focus on building your core features rather than developing AI capabilities from scratch.
